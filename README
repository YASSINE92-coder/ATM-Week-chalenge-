Hi, I am Yassine. I have finished a simple ATM project and I would like to share with you the right way to use it.

By running the project, you will first have to sign up.
After that, you can authenticate yourself to check one of the operations by choosing the equivalent operation number:

1 - Check balance
// The system will display your current balance.

2 - Deposit money
// The system will ask you how much you want to deposit, and it will run the operation by itself.

3 - Withdraw money
// The system will ask you how much you want to withdraw, and it will run the operation by itself.

4 - List the transaction history
// The system will display all the transactions with the following properties:
- type
- amount
- date

5 - Exit
// In this case, the system will log you out, so if you want to choose another operation, you will have to log in again.
